Shared react styled components for all the Zopa projects.

This repo contains 2 things at the same time:

- The typescript library for the react components

- A website for to show and try the components managed with [React-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org)
  which provides a development environment, a style guide website,
  interactive playground and other cool tools.

Check it out in [Github Pages](https://zopauk.github.io/react-components/)

### Documentation

Documentation first.

It is important to write good documentation for all the components.
React-styleguidist provides a development environment that provides a set of tools to make this process
more auto/magically simple.

All the **configuration** can be found at `styleguide.config.js` at the root of this project.

### Installation

- Run `yarn`

### Running the project

Run `yarn dev` to execute the dev environment.

The website will run at [localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060).

- Run `npm run dev` to execute the dev environment with hot reloading.

The website will run at [localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060)

### Motivation

The aim of this project is to share with the frontend community how we code in Zopa. We think it might be useful for
someone who wants to start a new react components library and want to re-use some of our code.
