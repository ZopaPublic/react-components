Shared react styled components for all the Zopa projects.

This repo contains 2 things at the same time:

- The Typescript library for the react components

- Documentation for the components managed with [React-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org)

[Check the docs üíï](https://zrc.netlify.app/)

## Migrating from version 3

There are a number of breaking changes which will need to be addressed when upgrading from Zopa React Components v3 to v4.

[The migration guide](/etc/docs/migration-v4.md) will walk you through the major changes such as colours and typography.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zopaUK/react-components.git
pnpm i
```

## Running the project

Execute the development environment:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The docs will run at [localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060).

## Local development (working on a linked application)

We start a watcher using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) by running:

```bash
pnpm dev:code
```

Your locally running app will have its own way of linking to local dependencies but making changes in react-components codebase should now show in the application.

## Motivation

The aim of this project is to share with the frontend community how we code in Zopa.

We think it might be useful for someone who wants to start a new react components library and want to re-use some of our code.

## Types

You can access typings for specific components under `@zopauk/react-components/types`:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@zopauk/react-components';
import { IButtonProps } from '@zopauk/react-components/types/components/atoms/Button';
```

To inspect the folder structure within `@zopauk/react-components/types` you can run `yarn compile:types` and navigate the generated `types/` folder in the project root.
