This is a subcomponent of `<Accordion />` and it is meant to be used along with other components such as `<Accordion.Header />` and the `useAccordion` hook.

It is a simple block element that passes down the ref to its childs. This forwarding allows the section to be collapsible.

Please refer to the `<Accordion />` documentation to see a working example.
