ZopaFooter renders Zopa's standard footer with default links and the ability to provide custom links.

#### default

```jsx
import { ZopaFooter } from '@zopauk/react-components';

<ZopaFooter />;
```

#### only legal section

You can also reduce the footer to just the legal section on pages where you need the user to focus on a specific task like form applications.

```jsx
import { ZopaFooter } from '@zopauk/react-components';

<ZopaFooter legalOnly />;
```
