Components for the UI.

Components are organized following the [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) conventions.
The only difference is that we focus on atoms and molecules, other more complex components (organisms, templates, pages, ...) are
shown as code examples but are not exported as a single component itself to avoid extra complexity.

## Usage

To use the components in your project simply import the desired component to your project as follows:

```js static
import { Button } from '@zopauk/react-components';
```

For complex components (organisms, templates, pages, ...) we can just click on "show code" and copy/paste the code to our project.
