## Themeing components

Out of the box, components within this library are provided with a default theme. However, the components will preferentially use a user-defined theme object. In order to make use of this feature, configure a theme object and make it available within your app via the [`<ThemeProvider>`](#/Components/Styles/ThemeProvider) component.
